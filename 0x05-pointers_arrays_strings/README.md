# STARTED WITH C
## My 6th project
### C - Pointers, arrays and strings



**Pointers:**

* Pointers are variables that store memory addresses as their values.
* They are used to manipulate and access memory directly.
* Common operations include declaring pointers, assigning addresses, dereferencing (accessing the value at the address), and performing pointer arithmetic.


**Arrays:**

* Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
* Elements in an array can be accessed using an index, starting from 0 for the first element.
* Arrays have a fixed size determined at declaration.


**Strings:**

* In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters (char[]).
* Strings are null-terminated, meaning they end with a special null character '\0'.
* Standard library functions like strlen, strcpy, and strcmp are used for string manipulation.
* Double quotes ("") are used to define string literals.


# Scripts:

### Task 0: Reset to 98 (0-reset_to_98.c)
- Description: This function takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to, setting it to 98. It's like giving a variable a fresh start! 🔄🔢
- Fun Fact: In C, pointers are incredibly powerful tools. They allow you to directly manipulate and access the memory where variables are stored, making them essential for tasks like this one! 🧰🔍

### Task 1: Swap Integers (1-swap.c)
- Description: This function swaps the values of two integers. It's like a magic trick where two variables change places, giving a new perspective to their values! 🪄🔄
- Fun Fact: Swapping values is a common operation in programming, especially in sorting algorithms. This simple-looking function is at the heart of complex tasks! 🧙‍♂️🧩

### Task 2: String Length (2-strlen.c)
- Description: This function calculates and returns the length of a string, which is the number of characters before the null terminator ('\0'). It's like measuring the length of a piece of string in the real world! 📏🧵
- Fun Fact: String length calculations are essential for tasks like printing or copying strings. They help ensure that you don't go beyond the allocated memory. 🧐📜

### Task 3: Print a String (3-puts.c)
- Description: This function prints a string to the standard output (stdout) followed by a newline character. It's like sending a message to the console for everyone to see! 📢🖥️
- Fun Fact: In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters. Printing a string is essentially printing each character until the null terminator is reached. 🧑‍💻📺

### Task 4: Reverse String (4-print_rev.c)
- Description: This function prints a string in reverse, starting from the last character and moving backward. It's like reading a book from the last page to the first! 📖↩️
- Fun Fact: Reversing a string is a useful operation in various scenarios, such as checking for palindromes or creating mirrored text effects. 🧐🔀

### Task 5: Reverse a String (5-rev_string.c)
- Description: This function reverses a string by changing the order of its characters. It's like turning a string inside out! 🔄🔤
- Fun Fact: String manipulation is a fundamental part of text processing in programming. This function provides insight into how strings can be transformed. 🧬🔃

### Task 6: Print Every Other Character (6-puts2.c)
- Description: This function prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character. It's like reading a book but only paying attention to every other word! 📚👀
- Fun Fact: This function uses a simple loop to control which characters are printed. It's a great example of how loops can affect the flow of a program. 🔄🧐

### Task 7: Print Half of a String (7-puts_half.c)
- Description: This function prints the second half of a string, even if the total length is odd. It's like sharing a piece of cake, making sure everyone gets their fair share! 🍰📊
- Fun Fact: Calculating the midpoint of a string and printing the second half can be tricky. This function handles it gracefully. 🧮📈

### Task 8: Print Array Elements (8-print_array.c)
- Description: This function prints a specified number of elements from an integer array, followed by a newline. It's like showcasing a selection of items from a larger collection! 🖼️🔢
- Fun Fact: Arrays are essential data structures in programming. Printing specific elements allows you to present data in a meaningful way. 🧮📈

### Task 9: String Copy (9-strcpy.c)
- Description: This function copies the content of one string (including the null terminator) to another string. It's like creating an identical twin for a string! 👯‍♂️📜
- Fun Fact: String manipulation functions like strcpy are essential for tasks like creating backups, concatenating strings, and more. 📚🧬

### Task 10: String to Integer (100-atoi.c)
- Description: This function converts a string containing digits into an integer. It's like deciphering a numeric code hidden within a string! 🔢🔐
- Fun Fact: atoi stands for "ASCII to integer" and is a crucial function for tasks like parsing user input, converting strings to numbers, and performing mathematical operations. 🧩🔢

### Task 11: Password Generator (101-keygen.c)
- Description: This program generates random valid passwords for a specific program, 101-crackme. It's like creating unique and secure keys to unlock a secret vault! 🗝️🔒
- Fun Fact: Password generation involves various techniques, such as using random numbers and character sets. It's an essential aspect of cybersecurity. 🌐🤖
