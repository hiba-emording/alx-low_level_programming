## My 6th project
### C - Pointers, arrays and strings



**Pointers:**

* Pointers are variables that store memory addresses as their values.
* They are used to manipulate and access memory directly.
* Common operations include declaring pointers, assigning addresses, dereferencing (accessing the value at the address), and performing pointer arithmetic.


**Arrays:**

* Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
* Elements in an array can be accessed using an index, starting from 0 for the first element.
* Arrays have a fixed size determined at declaration.


**Strings:**

* In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters (char[]).
* Strings are null-terminated, meaning they end with a special null character '\0'.
* Standard library functions like strlen, strcpy, and strcmp are used for string manipulation.
* Double quotes ("") are used to define string literals.
