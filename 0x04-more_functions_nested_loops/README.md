# STARTED WITH C
## My 5th project
### 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops


### Scripts:

0. **Uppercase Checker (_isupper.c)**
    - Description: This function checks for an uppercase character.
    - Fun Fact: In ASCII, uppercase letters have specific numeric values that can be used to identify them in code. This function harnesses that knowledge to distinguish uppercase characters! 🌟🔤

1. **Digit Detective (_isdigit.c)**
    - Description: This function checks for a digit (0 through 9).
    - Fun Fact: Characters in programming are represented by numbers, and digits are a specific range of character values. This function is like a detective that knows the digits' secret code! 🔍🕵️‍♂️

2. **Multiplication Maestro (2-mul.c)**
    - Description: This function multiplies two integers.
    - Fun Fact: Multiplication is one of the fundamental operations in mathematics and programming. This function is like a math wizard that can multiply numbers with ease! 🧙‍♂️✨🔢

3. **Number Printer (3-print_numbers.c)**
    - Description: This function prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
    - Fun Fact: Printing numbers is one of the basic building blocks of programming. This function is like a number DJ, spinning tunes from 0 to 9! 🎶🔢

4. **Selective Number Printer (4-print_most_numbers.c)**
    - Description: This function prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line, but skips printing 2 and 4.
    - Fun Fact: Sometimes, you need to be selective in what you print. This function is like a printer with a quirky sense of humor, skipping numbers 2 and 4 just for fun! 😄🔢

5. **Number Multiplexer (5-more_numbers.c)**
    - Description: This function prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
    - Fun Fact: Loops are powerful tools in programming. This function is like a loop conductor, orchestrating the numbers from 0 to 14 in a grand performance! 🎼🔢

6. **Straight Line Artist (6-print_line.c)**
    - Description: This function draws a straight line in the terminal.
    - Fun Fact: Drawing shapes with characters in the terminal is like creating ASCII art. This function is like an ASCII artist, drawing a perfect straight line for you! 🖼️🔳

7. **Diagonal Line Designer (7-print_diagonal.c)**
    - Description: This function draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
    - Fun Fact: Drawing diagonal lines requires careful control of characters. This function is like a diagonal architect, creating elegant diagonal lines! 📐🔲

8. **Square Magician (8-print_square.c)**
    - Description: This function prints a square, followed by a new line.
    - Fun Fact: Squares are fascinating geometric shapes. This function is like a square sorcerer, conjuring perfect square patterns! 🔮🔲

9. **Fizz Buzz Explorer (9-fizz_buzz.c)**
    - Description: This program prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of three with "Fizz" and multiples of five with "Buzz," followed by a new line.
    - Fun Fact: Fizz Buzz is a classic programming problem often used in coding interviews. This program is like a Fizz Buzz maestro, transforming numbers into playful words! 🎈🎉

10. **Triangle Architect (10-print_triangle.c)**
    - Description: This function prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
    - Fun Fact: Triangles are fascinating geometric shapes with unique patterns. This function is like a triangle builder, crafting beautiful triangle designs! 🏔️🔺

11. **Prime Factor Detective (100-prime_factor.c)**
    - Description: This program finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.
    - Fun Fact: Prime factors are essential in number theory and cryptography. This program is like a detective searching for the prime factor treasure in a giant number jungle! 🕵️‍♂️💎

12. **Number Picasso (101-print_number.c)**
    - Description: This function prints an integer using only _putchar().
    - Fun Fact: Printing numbers using custom functions can be a creative endeavor. This function is like an artistic printer, painting numbers with _putchar() strokes! 🎨✒️
