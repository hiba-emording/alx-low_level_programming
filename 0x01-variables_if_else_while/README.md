# STARTED WITH C
## My Second Project
### 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while



**Variables in C:**

* Variables are like containers that store data.
* They can hold different types of information, such as numbers or text.
* You give variables names to refer to them in your program.


**If-Else Statements in C:**

* If-else statements help your program make decisions.
* They allow your program to choose different actions based on conditions.


**While Loops in C:**

* Let you repeat a set of instructions as long as a condition is true.
* They are like a "do this while that's true" kind of instruction.
* Useful for tasks like counting or repeating an action until a goal is met.

*will add scripts explanation later on...cause deadline is too close!*
