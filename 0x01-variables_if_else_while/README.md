# STARTED WITH C
## My Second Project
### 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while



**Variables in C:**

* Variables are like containers that store data.
* They can hold different types of information, such as numbers or text.
* You give variables names to refer to them in your program.


**If-Else Statements in C:**

* If-else statements help your program make decisions.
* They allow your program to choose different actions based on conditions.


**While Loops in C:**

* Let you repeat a set of instructions as long as a condition is true.
* They are like a "do this while that's true" kind of instruction.
* Useful for tasks like counting or repeating an action until a goal is met.

## Scripts:

*Used betty coding style and documentation*

#### Task 0: Positive or Negative (0-positive_or_negative.c)
- **Description:** In this task, you'll work with random numbers and conditionals. Your mission is to determine whether a random number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Fun Fact:** This task is like flipping a coin and deciding whether it's heads, tails, or landed on its edge! 🪙

#### Task 1: The Last Digit (1-last_digit.c)
- **Description:** Get ready to extract the last digit from random numbers. Your goal is to print information about the last digit, such as whether it's greater than 5 or not.
- **Fun Fact:** Extracting the last digit is like revealing the secret code at the end of a treasure map! 🗺️

#### Task 2: The Alphabet Game (2-print_alphabet.c)
- **Description:** Time to print the lowercase alphabet using the `putchar` function. Challenge yourself to do it with only two `putchar` calls!
- **Fun Fact:** Printing the alphabet with limited `putchar` calls is like creating art with a restricted color palette. 🎨

#### Task 3: alphABET (3-print_alphabets.c)
- **Description:** Let's level up and print both lowercase and uppercase alphabets. Can you do it with just three `putchar` calls?
- **Fun Fact:** Printing both lowercase and uppercase letters is like speaking in multiple languages at once! 🌍

#### Task 4: Soup's Missing Letters (4-print_alphabt.c)
- **Description:** Time to print the alphabet while skipping the letters 'q' and 'e'. Keep it concise with only two `putchar` calls!
- **Fun Fact:** Skipping letters is like reading a coded message. It's a skill used in data filtering and text processing. 🧩

#### Task 5: Numbers (5-print_numbers.c)
- **Description:** Challenge yourself to print single-digit numbers from 0 to 9 using only the `putchar` function.
- **Fun Fact:** Printing numbers is like counting stars in the night sky—one by one! ✨

#### Task 6: Numberz (6-print_numberz.c)
- **Description:** Print those single-digit numbers again, but this time without using a `char` variable. Can you do it with just two `putchar` calls?
- **Fun Fact:** Printing numbers without `char` variables is like playing a game with limited resources. It's efficient coding! 🎮

#### Task 7: Smile in the Mirror (7-print_tebahpla.c)
- **Description:** Reflect on the alphabet and print it in reverse order using only two `putchar` calls.
- **Fun Fact:** Reversing the alphabet is like rewinding time in a movie—it's a different perspective! ⏮️

#### Task 8: Hexadecimal (8-print_base16.c)
- **Description:** Dive into the world of hexadecimal numbers and print them in lowercase using just three `putchar` calls.
- **Fun Fact:** Hexadecimal is like speaking a language where numbers have more characters. It's used in low-level programming and encoding! 🧮

#### Task 9: Patience, Persistence, and Numbers (9-print_comb.c)
- **Description:** Combine patience and code to print combinations of single-digit numbers separated by commas and spaces. Can you do it with just four `putchar` calls?
- **Fun Fact:** Printing combinations is like solving puzzles. It's a fundamental skill for generating permutations and more! 🧩

#### Task 10: Inventing Combinations (100-print_comb3.c)
- **Description:** Invent unique combinations of two digits and print them with commas and spaces. Challenge yourself to do it with only five `putchar` calls!
- **Fun Fact:** Creating combinations is like crafting a playlist with your favorite songs. It's about finding harmony! 🎶

#### Task 11: Success Combination (101-print_comb4.c)
- **Description:** Explore the world of combinations further and print unique combinations of three digits. Can you do it with only six `putchar` calls?
- **Fun Fact:** Combinations are like mixing ingredients to create a unique recipe. It's a key concept in combinatorics and probability! 🍳

#### Task 12: Software Secrets (102-print_comb5.c)
- **Description:** Crack the code and print combinations of two two-digit numbers with style. Create a digital chessboard with numbers!
- **Fun Fact:** Printing combinations of two-digit numbers is like revealing hidden patterns in data. It's used in various algorithms and data analysis! 🕵️‍♂️🔍
