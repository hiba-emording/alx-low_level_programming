# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists

This project contains C functions that manipulate doubly linked lists.

## Overview
This set of C files comprises functions that perform various operations on doubly linked lists. Each file implements a specific function related to handling and modifying doubly linked list nodes.

## Scripts
1. **Print list**
    - File: `0-print_dlistint.c`
    - Description: Function to print all elements of a doubly-linked list.

2. **List length**
    - File: `1-dlistint_len.c`
    - Description: Function to return the number of nodes in a doubly-linked list.

3. **Add node**
    - File: `2-add_dnodeint.c`
    - Description: Function to add a new node at the beginning of a doubly-linked list.

4. **Add node at the end**
    - File: `3-add_dnodeint_end.c`
    - Description: Function to add a new node at the end of a doubly-linked list.

5. **Free list**
    - File: `4-free_dlistint.c`
    - Description: Function to free a doubly-linked list.

6. **Get node at index**
    - File: `5-get_dnodeint.c`
    - Description: Function to locate a given node of a doubly-linked list by index.

7. **Sum list**
    - File: `6-sum_dlistint.c`
    - Description: Function to sum all the data (n) of a doubly-linked list.

8. **Insert at index**
    - File: `7-insert_dnodeint.c`
    - Description: Function to insert a new node at a given position in the list.

9. **Delete at index**
    - File: `8-delete_dnodeint.c`
    - Description: Function to delete a node at a specific index in a doubly-linked list.
