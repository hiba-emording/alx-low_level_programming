### 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
 
*Nested loops in C are loops within loops, where one loop is contained inside another.
They allow you to execute a set of instructions multiple times, and these loops can be used for various tasks.*

* Outer Loop: The outer loop controls the overall flow of the program.
It determines how many times the inner loop(s) will execute. You can think of it as the parent loop.

* Inner Loop(s): The inner loop(s) are contained within the outer loop.
They execute a set of statements a specific number of times for each iteration of the outer loop. These are often referred to as nested loops.

* Iteration: Each time the outer loop runs, it goes through one iteration.
For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop(s) may also iterate a certain number of times.

* Usage: Nested loops are commonly used for tasks that involve processing two-dimensional or multi-dimensional data structures, like arrays or matrices.
They are also used for generating patterns, grids, and for solving problems where you need to examine combinations or permutations.
