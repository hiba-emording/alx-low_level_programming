# STARTED WITH C
## FIRST PROJECT
### 0x00. C - Hello, World

üöÄ Welcome to the world of C programming, where we embark on a journey of code exploration and discovery. This project consists of a series of tasks that will introduce you to the fundamental aspects of C programming. Let's dive in and uncover the magic of C! üåü

## Scripts:

### Task 0: Preprocessor (0-preprocessor)
- **Description:** This script runs a C file through the preprocessor, taking the C file name stored in the variable `$CFILE`, and saves the preprocessed result into a file named `c`.
- **Fun Fact:** The preprocessor is like a language translator, converting C code into a form that the compiler can understand. üìú

### Task 1: Compiler (1-compiler)
- **Description:** In this task, we compile a C file without linking it. The C file name is stored in `$CFILE`, and the output file is named the same as the C file but with the `.o` extension.
- **Fun Fact:** Compiling is like translating human language into machine language, making it ready for the computer to execute. üõ†Ô∏è

### Task 2: Assembler (2-assembler)
- **Description:** This script generates the assembly code of a C program and saves it in an output file. The C file name is stored in `$CFILE`, and the output file is named with a `.s` extension.
- **Fun Fact:** Assembly code is a low-level representation of the program, providing a bridge between human-readable code and machine instructions. üí°

### Task 3: Name (3-name)
- **Description:** Here, we compile a C file and create an executable named `cisfun`. The C file name is stored in `$CFILE`.
- **Fun Fact:** Executables are like magic spells; they make the computer perform specific tasks when invoked. ‚ú®

### Task 4: Hello, puts (4-puts.c)
- **Description:** Write a C program that prints "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line, using the function `puts`.
- **Fun Fact:** The `puts` function is like a message in a bottle, sending your text to the console for all to see. üß©

### Task 5: Hello, printf (5-printf.c)
- **Description:** Create a C program that prints "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art," followed by a new line, using the `printf` function.
- **Fun Fact:** `printf` is like a master artist, allowing you to craft your output with precision and style. üé®

### Task 6: Size is not grandeur (6-size.c)
- **Description:** Write a C program that prints the sizes of various types on the computer it's compiled and run on. The output should match the example provided.
- **Fun Fact:** Knowing the sizes of data types is like understanding the building blocks of your computer's memory. üèóÔ∏è

### Task 7: Intel (100-intel)
- **Description:** This script generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C program and saves it in an output file. The C file name is stored in the variable `$CFILE`, and the output file has a `.s` extension.
- **Fun Fact:** Different assembly syntaxes are like different dialects in a language; they convey the same meaning but with variations. üí¨

### Task 8: UNIX is basically a simple operating system (101-quote.c)
- **Description:** Create a C program that prints "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
- **Fun Fact:** Printing to standard error is like leaving a note where everyone can see it, but with a bit of a twist. üìù
