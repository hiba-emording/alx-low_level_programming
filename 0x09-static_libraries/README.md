# STARTED WITH C
## Project number 10
### 0x09. C - Static libraries


### Task 0: Created a Static Library ðŸ“š
- **File:** `libmy.a`, `main.h`
- **Description:** In this task, I created a static library named `libmy.a`. This library contained a collection of essential C functions, each serving a unique purpose, from character handling to string manipulation.
- **Fun Fact:** Static libraries, denoted by the ".a" file extension, have been a staple in C programming for decades, enabling code reuse and modularity. ðŸ’¼

### Task 1: Script for Library Creation ðŸ“œ
- **File:** `create_static_lib.sh`
- **Description:** For this task, I created a handy script, `create_static_lib.sh`. This script automated the process of building a static library (`liball.a`) by collecting and archiving all the relevant `.c` files in the current directory.
- **Fun Fact:** Automation scripts like this one make the software development process more efficient and reduce the chance of errors. ðŸš€
