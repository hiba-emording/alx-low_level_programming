## STARTED WITH C
### PROJECT NUMBER 21

# 0x15. C - File I/O
* In this project, we delve into the world of file input and output (I/O) in C.
File I/O is a fundamental concept in programming, allowing us to interact with files, read their contents, create new files, and more.

## Task 0: Tread Lightly 📜
- **File:** `0-read_textfile.c`
- **Description:** In this task, I created a function called `read_textfile` that reads a text file and prints its content to the POSIX standard output. We specify the number of letters to read and print.

## Task 1: Create File 📝
- **File:** `1-create_file.c`
- **Description:** In this task, I implemented a function named `create_file` that generates a new file. The function accepts a filename and text content, writing the content to the file. It returns 1 on success and -1 on failure.

## Task 2: Append Text 🧩
- **File:** `2-append_text_to_file.c`
- **Description:** In this task, I wrote a function called `append_text_to_file` that appends text to the end of an existing file. The function returns 1 on success and -1 on failure.

## Task 3: Copy Content 📄
- **File:** `3-cp.c`
- **Description:** In this task, I created a program named `cp` that copies the content of one file to another. The program handles various scenarios and permissions, ensuring that data is correctly read, written, and file descriptors are properly closed.

> These tasks underscore the significance of file I/O in C programming, providing the ability to read, write, create, and duplicate data across files. Just as we interact with documents in our daily lives, these tasks teach us how to manage files programmatically.
