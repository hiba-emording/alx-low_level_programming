# STARTED WITH C
## Project number 11
### 0x0A. C - argc, argv

* In this project, I worked on various C programs that use the `argc` and `argv` arguments commonly used in C to handle command-line input.
These arguments allow programs to receive inputs and configurations directly from the command line.

## Task 0: What's My Name? 🤔
- **File:** `0-whatsmyname.c`
- **Description:** This program prints its own name, followed by a newline. Even if you rename the program, it will still print the new name without needing to recompile. It keeps track of its own identity.
- **Fun Fact:** Did you know that the concept of "self-awareness" in programming can be quite handy? By accessing its own name, a program can adapt to its environment and respond to different names, just like a chameleon.

## Task 1: Counting Arguments 🧮
- **File:** `1-args.c`
- **Description:** This program prints the number of arguments passed into it. It counts the arguments and displays the count followed by a newline.
- **Fun Fact:** In the world of programming, counting arguments is like counting the number of guests at a party. It helps you know how many "guests" (arguments) have arrived!

## Task 2: Printing Arguments 📝
- **File:** `2-args.c`
- **Description:** This program prints all the arguments it receives, including the first one. Each argument is printed on a separate line, ensuring clear and organized output.
- **Fun Fact:** Imagine each argument as a note in a melody, and this program plays them all, one by one, to create a symphony of information!

## Task 3: Multiplying Numbers 🧮
- **File:** `3-mul.c`
- **Description:** This program multiplies two numbers and prints the result followed by a newline. It also handles the case where it doesn't receive two arguments, providing an error message and returning 1 in such cases.
- **Fun Fact:** The magic of multiplication can turn small numbers into big ones! This program works its mathematical wizardry to create new values.

## Task 4: Adding Positive Numbers ➕
- **File:** `4-add.c`
- **Description:** This program adds positive numbers and prints the result followed by a newline. It accounts for cases where no numbers are passed and checks for non-digit symbols, providing appropriate error messages.
- **Fun Fact:** Just like a calculator, this program adds numbers for you, and if someone tries to trick it with symbols, it knows how to respond with an error message!

## Task 5: Minimal Number of Coins for Change 💰
- **File:** `100-change.c`
- **Description:** This program calculates the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount of money (in cents). It handles various scenarios, such as checking the number of arguments, parsing inputs, and dealing with negative values.
- **Fun Fact:** Counting coins can be a fun challenge! This program uses an algorithmic approach to find the best combination of coins for change, just like a puzzle solver.


> These tasks showcase the versatility of using `argc` and `argv` to create command-line programs that can handle different inputs and produce meaningful output.

Remember, "It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to." – So, let these programs answer your commands and share some coding fun along the way!

Feel free to explore each task's code and test them out with different command-line arguments.
