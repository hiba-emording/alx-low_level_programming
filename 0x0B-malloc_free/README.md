# STARTED WITH C
## PROJECT NUMBER 12
### 0x0B-malloc-free


* In this project, I worked on tasks that involved memory allocation and deallocation using the `malloc` and `free` functions in C.
 These tasks required careful memory management to create, manipulate, and release dynamic memory.

## Task 0: Float like a Butterfly, Sting like a Bee 🦋🐝
- **File:** `0-create_array.c`
- **Description:** This task required writing a function that creates an array of characters and initializes it with a specific character. The function handles various cases, including returning `NULL` if `size` is 0 or if memory allocation fails.
- **Fun Fact:** Muhammad Ali's famous quote, "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee," emphasizes agility and precision in boxing. In programming, memory allocation and manipulation require similar precision.

## Task 1: Imagination and Wings ✨🦋
- **File:** `1-strdup.c`
- **Description:** This task involved creating a function that duplicates a given string by allocating memory with `malloc`. The function returns a pointer to the newly duplicated string and handles cases where `str` is `NULL` or when memory allocation fails.
- **Fun Fact:** Imagination can take you to new places, and in this task, we're using memory allocation to create a "copy" of a string, allowing us to explore new possibilities.

## Task 2: Courage and Risks 💪🚀
- **File:** `2-str_concat.c`
- **Description:** This task required implementing a function to concatenate two strings by allocating memory dynamically. The function handles special cases, such as treating `NULL` as an empty string and returning `NULL` on failure.
- **Fun Fact:** Just as courage is essential to take risks in life, dynamic memory allocation is a crucial aspect of programming that allows us to handle various situations.

## Task 3: Dreams and Apologies 💭🙏
- **File:** `3-alloc_grid.c`
- **Description:** This task involved creating a function that returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers. The function initializes each element to 0 and handles cases where width or height is 0 or negative, returning `NULL` on failure.
- **Fun Fact:** Dreams can lead to great accomplishments, just like a well-allocated 2D array can be the foundation for complex data structures and solutions.

## Task 4: Backing It Up 🙌
- **File:** `4-free_grid.c`
- **Description:** This task required implementing a function to free a 2-dimensional grid created by a previous `alloc_grid` function. The function ensures proper memory cleanup.
- **Fun Fact:** In programming, "backing it up" means properly releasing memory to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient resource management.

## Task 5: Mountains and Pebbles 🏔️👟
- **File:** `100-argstostr.c`
- **Description:** This task involved creating a function that concatenates all the arguments of a program into a single string. Each argument is followed by a newline character. The function handles cases where `ac` is 0 or `av` is `NULL`.
- **Fun Fact:** Just as climbing mountains can be challenging, parsing and concatenating command-line arguments require careful handling of details, even the smallest ones.

## Task 6: Showing Greatness 🏆
- **File:** `101-strtow.c`
- **Description:** This task required creating a function that splits a string into words. The function returns an array of strings (words), with the last element being `NULL`. Words are separated by spaces, and the function handles various cases for input validation.
- **Fun Fact:** Much like greatness is achieved by breaking challenges into smaller steps, this task involves breaking a string into words to better understand its contents.
